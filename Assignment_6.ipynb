    "    Data abstraction hides unnecessary code details from the user. Also,  when we do not want to give out sensitive parts of our code implementation and this is where data abstraction came.\n",
    "    Data Abstraction in Python can be achieved by creating abstract classes.\n",
    "    eg:\n",
    "     We use the TV remote to switch the TV ON or OFF, switch to different channels, and raise or lower the volume. The TV user only knows he/she may use the buttons on the remote to do it. What they don’t know is how all this is happening internally, for example how the TV sensor is capturing signals from the TV remote and then how it is processing the received signals to perform the required action of changing the channel, etc. All the internal functionality is hidden, as for the user it might not be necessary for them to know how that is happening.\n",

    "Abstraction shows only useful data by providing the most necessary details, whereas Encapsulation wraps code and data for necessary information.\n",

    "Abstraction:-- Implementation hiding.\n",
    "\n",

    "Abstraction: Only necessary information is shown. Let's focus on the example of switching on a computer. The user does not have to know what goes on while the system is still loading (that information is hidden from the user).\n",
